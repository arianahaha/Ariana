The goal of Ariana is to compute survival probabilities

## Installation

You can install the development version of Ariana from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arianahaha/Ariana")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Ariana)
time = c(1:200)
event = sample(c(0,1), replace=TRUE, size=200)

survival = survival.probs(time, event)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(survival)
```
